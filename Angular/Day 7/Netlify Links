INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:
1. Make sure your system has node installed in it.
2. Copy the file to your local system.
3. Go to console and do the following:
  3.1  tsc <pathtofile>/<filename>.ts  --> compiles .ts and creates .js file
  3.2  node <pathtofile>/<filename>.js  --> to run the .js file
4. You can see the output in the console window

NOTE: As I am unable to get the console output in HTML file, I didnt create it.
